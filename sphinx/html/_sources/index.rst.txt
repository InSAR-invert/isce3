Welcome to ISCE's python documentation!
=======================================

ISCE's Python interface is built as three separate layers:

1. Python interface 
2. Lower-level cython interface for interacing with C++ code
3. Pyre interface for user-facing workflows

The Pyre interface uses the Cython interface to control the behavior of underlying C++ modules for coordinating behavior of different modules in workflows.
